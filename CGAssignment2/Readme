This project relies on the boost framework! Specifically, it uses boost::shared_ptr
to simplify reference counting and pointer management for the scene graph.

Install boost here: http://www.boost.org/users/download/

I reused my CGMouseInput and CGNode/CGNodeManager scene graph from the last project to save
myself a lot of work. CGCelestialBody has lots of methods to facilitate the simulation
we're modeling in this project.

The controls are rendered to the screen in the top-left.

The makefile should successfully compile the CGAssignment2 application. There's also
a couple of other targets, mostly various unit tests for parts of the application.


Build Instructions:

    `make all` will build the project and all dependencies
    
    Make sure to use the makefile in the root directory, not the one in the Debug directory.
    That makefile is automatically generated by eclipse and won't work if you're not on the
    Mac OSX platform.
    
    Alternatively, you can use the .project file to use eclipse on Mac OSX to build the project
